//RSAEncrypt.java : Encrypts a file

//Your program, “RSAGenKey.java”, either takes the key size as input or  take input as p, q, and e.
// If  only one argument k is given, the program randomly picks p and q in k bits and generates a key pair. 
//For example:
//c:\> java  RSAGenKey 12
//Two files will be created.: pub_key.txt and pri_key.txt.  pub_key.txt contains a public key in the 
//following format:
//e = 8311
//n = 31005883
//pri_key.txt contains the corresponding private key in the following format:
//d = 11296191
//n = 31005883
//If the program takes p, q, and e as the input (java RSAGenKey p q e), it should generate 
//the corresponding private key. The key pair should also be saved in two files as described above. 
//For example
//c:\> java RSA 6551 4733 8311
//The same files pub_key.txt and pri_key.txt should be created.
